# Profit-prediction-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression
This project estimates a multiple linear regression of 50 startups and how their expenses on R &amp; D, administration, marketing, and location can be significant or not to their profits.

## Prediction Task-----
* Task 1 - We will be predicting the profit from the startup’s dataset with the features available to us. 
* Task 1 - We’re using the 50-startups dataset for this problem statement and we will be using the concept of Multiple linear regression to predict the profit of startups companies
